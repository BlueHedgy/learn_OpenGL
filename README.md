# learn_OpenGL
This repo is a proof of learning.
All credits goes to  Joey De Vries and his course at : https://learnopengl.com/
The codes in here mostly align with his example with some of my personal tweeks in the project structure as well as a few custom changes in functionality.

Libraries used: GLFW3, GLM, GLAD, ASSIMP

The code contains some extra classes and definitions that i wrote for objects classes e.g Cubes  

I will continue to update this as i go through the process.
